//! Internal message types used for coordinating work across worker tasks.
//!
//! This module defines [`WorkRequest`], the internal command protocol used by
//! the [`WorkerPool`](crate::server::service::pool::manager::WorkerPool) to
//! dispatch work to individual worker tasks. It includes variants for streamed
//! ID generation and graceful shutdown.
//!
//! ## Variants
//!
//! - [`Stream`]: Request to generate a specified number of Snowflake IDs,
//!   streamed back via a channel in chunked form.
//! - [`Shutdown`]: Request to gracefully shut down a worker and acknowledge
//!   termination via a one-shot channel.
//!
//! These messages are sent over bounded MPSC channels from the dispatcher to
//! the worker loop. Cancellation and backpressure logic are handled by the
//! receiver side in the worker implementation.
