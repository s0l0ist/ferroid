# ðŸ¤– ferroid

**ferroid** is a modular Rust workspace for generating and streaming
time-sortable IDs, including **Snowflake-style** IDs and **ULIDs**.

This workspace includes:

- `ferroid`: Core ID logic and generators
- `ferroid-tonic-core`: gRPC protocol definitions and shared types
- `ferroid-tonic-server`: A gRPC server that streams binary packed ID chunks
  over a network

## ðŸ“¦ Workspace Structure

### `crates/ferroid`

The core library. Provides:

- **ID Types**: Snowflake (`u64`, `u128`), ULID (`u128`)
- **Custom Layout**: macros to help build your own ID layout
- **Generators**:

  - `BasicSnowflakeGenerator`: single-threaded
  - `LockSnowflakeGenerator`: multi-threaded with locking
  - `AtomicSnowflakeGenerator`: multi-threaded, lock-free
  - `BasicUlidGenerator`: multi-threaded, high-entropy ULID generation

- **Async Support**: Integrates with `tokio` and `smol`
- **Encoding Support**: Crockford base32 encoding/decoding for compact, sortable
  string IDs

This is the crate you'll typically depend on for ID generation.

### `crates/ferroid-tonic-core`

Defines the gRPC protocol and shared types for ID streaming:

- `ferroid.proto` for ID stream requests and packed binary responses
- Shared types used by both client and server
- Ensures type compatibility across deployments

Note: The server and client should be compiled with the same
`ferroid-tonic-core`. If you're overriding the default ID
(`SnowflakeTwitterId`), please fork this repo to ensure contract stability
between client and server.

### `crates/ferroid-tonic-server`

A gRPC server for streaming IDs:

- Supports streaming chunked IDs
- Concurrent worker task pool with backpressure
- Graceful shutdown and stream cancellation
- Optional compression (`zstd`, `gzip`, `deflate`)
- OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing

Run this to expose high-throughput ID generation as a network service.

```bash
cargo run -p ferroid-tonic-server --features tracing
```
